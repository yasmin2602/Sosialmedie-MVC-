2024-11-29 23:55:40.342 +01:00 [ERR] The migration operation 'PRAGMA foreign_keys = 0;
' from migration 'UpdateIdentitySchema' cannot be executed in a transaction. If the app is terminated or an unrecoverable error occurs while this operation is being executed then the migration will be left in a partially applied state and would need to be reverted manually before it can be applied again. Create a separate migration that contains just this operation.
